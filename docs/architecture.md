# Asha AI Chatbot Architecture

## Overview

Asha AI Chatbot is an intelligent assistant designed for the JobsForHer Foundation platform to support women in their career journeys. The system uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), context-aware conversations, and bias mitigation techniques to provide relevant, empowering information about jobs, events, and mentorship opportunities.

## System Components

### 1. RAG Pipeline (rag_pipeline.py)

The core information retrieval system that connects user queries to relevant data sources:

- **Semantic Search Engine**: Uses embeddings to match user queries with relevant information
- **Data Integration**: Pulls information from structured data (CSV, JSON) and external APIs
- **Response Generation**: Crafts natural language responses based on retrieved information

### 2. Context Manager (context_manager.py)

Maintains conversation history and enables multi-turn interactions:

- **Session Management**: Tracks conversations using unique session IDs
- **Context Window**: Maintains a configurable window of recent interactions
- **State Tracking**: Preserves conversational context for more coherent responses

### 3. Bias Detection Module (bias_detection.py)

Ensures ethical AI-driven responses:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies potentially biased language in user queries
- **Redirection Mechanisms**: Offers constructive alternatives to biased assumptions
- **Inclusive Language**: Promotes factual, positive framing of career topics

### 4. Fallback Module (fallback_module.py)

Handles edge cases and ensures graceful degradation:

- **Error Detection**: Recognizes when queries cannot be answered confidently
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Redirects users to related topics when exact answers aren't available
- **Human Escalation**: Provides pathways to human support when needed

### 5. API Integrations (api_integrations.py)

Connects to external data sources:

- **Job Listing APIs**: Fetches real-time job opportunities
- **Events Database**: Updates information about upcoming workshops and networking events
- **Mentorship Platform**: Retrieves current mentorship program availability

### 6. User Interface (ui.py)

Provides the interaction layer:

- **Streamlit Web Interface**: Accessible, responsive chat interface
- **Response Formatting**: Presents information in user-friendly formats
- **Feedback Collection**: Gathers user input on response quality

## Data Flow

1. User submits a query through the UI
2. Query is checked for bias and processed by the main application
3. Context manager adds conversation history for multi-turn awareness
4. RAG pipeline retrieves relevant information from knowledge sources
5. Response is generated based on retrieved information and conversation context
6. Response is delivered to user through the UI
7. User interaction is logged for performance monitoring

## Security & Privacy

- No personally identifiable information is stored
- Session data is non-personalized and temporary
- All data processing follows privacy-by-design principles

## Performance Monitoring

- Response accuracy metrics
- User engagement tracking
- Bias detection effectiveness
- System latency monitoring

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-language support
- Voice interface integration
- Personalized career recommendations
- Advanced analytics dashboard
